# TidyTuesday

My contributions to the #TidyTuesday challenge, a weekly project intiated by Thomas Mock and organized by the R4DS ("R for Data Science") online learning community.
Each week a new data set is shared and the community have a go at finding a story to tell from the data. Visualisations are shared via Twitter using the #TidyTuesday hashtag.
So far my contributions have focused on improving my fluency with the {tidyverse} packages including {ggplot2} and {dplyr}.
